<h2>Let me introduce you...</h2>
<p>
	<em>What in the world is this?</em> - you'll probably ask when you first visit this website.<br />
	This is going to become an interactive electronics tutorial. If i will finish it, of course.<br />

	<br />

	<em>Interactive electronics tutorial? What's that?</em> See, when you do want to learn something,
	it's always better to see it in action than just read tons of text 'bout it. The same is true fofr electronics.
	It's really hard to understand the difference between <em>p-n-p</em> an <em>n-p-n</em> transistors when you
	did not even seen them before! For example, i did not understand that difference until i started this project 
	<%= image_tag 'smilies/smiley-razz.png', { :class => 'smiley' } %><br />

	<br />

	<em>p-n-p? Transistor? Too many difficult words!</em> Just click in the menu "Let's start" above and dive
	into the world of electronics!
</p>

<h2>Oh, there's something missing...</h2>
<p>
	Yeah, this project is in an early development yet. I even do not know if i will be able to finish it!
	Still, this is only my coursework. A very, very pretty coursework <%= image_tag 'smilies/smiley-lol.png', { :class => 'smiley' } %>
	So, don't  be upset! If i'll find the reason to add something to this project - i'll surely do it!
	Have fun! <%= image_tag 'smilies/smiley-wink.png', { :class => 'smiley' } %>

<h2>What's gonna be clicked next?</h2>
<p>
	<em>Well, i see some strange pictures and light rectangle. So, what's next?</em> That rectangle is a 
	<em>scheme sheet</em>. It is the right place to create a schemes - a set of connected symbols,
	intertwined into a diabolic picture called <em>(electronic) circuit</em>. It shows the heretics
	called "engineers", which part should be connected to which parts and how the device will work at all.<br />

	<br />

	The rectangle with odd pictures above the sheet is the <em>toolbar</em>. It will become your mostly used
	part of the site (taking into account the fact you want to <strong>experiment</strong> mostly).
	It is divided into three parts:
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>the component container</strong> - the place, where all the components the system knows
			are located. They are represented by their <em>symbols</em> - that strange pictures
			as rectangles, triangles, circles and lines. Click on one of them and it will appear
			in the <em>top-left</em> corner of your sheet. Then you'll be able to operate with
			the component using your mouse and the edit panel.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<strong>the edit panel</strong> - the one which allows you to rotate your components clockwise
			<%= image_tag 'buttons/arrow-circle-225.png', { :class => 'button' } %> and remove the selected component and its
			connections from the sheet <%= image_tag 'buttons/cross-script.png', { :class => 'button' } %>. You can select one
			of your components clicking on it with the left mouse button. To deselect component simply
			click somewhere on the sheet where no component is located.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<strong>the run process controls</strong> - buttons, which start the magick are located here!
			They allow you to run all the scheme at once <%= image_tag 'buttons/arrow-repeat.png', { :class => 'button' } %>, to step your run process
			one step along (e.g. to invoke the next "wave" of components) <%= image_tag 'buttons/arrow-repeat-once.png', { :class => 'button' } %> or to
			reset all the scheme <%= image_tag 'buttons/arrow-circle-double.png', { :class => 'button' } %> - to clean the execution component queue and reset each component
			states.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br />
	
	<em>Now let's try to do something... Errr... How?</em> There are no tricks. User Interface (aka <em>UI</em>)
	is aimed to be as easy and user-friendly as possible. So, here's the list on how things are done:
	
	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Add a component to the sheet
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Click on the component's icon
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Drag the component over the sheet
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Press your left mouse button over the component. <strong>Do not unpress it yet!</strong>
			Move it with the component selected to the place you want. And now, unpress the left
			mouse button.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Select the component
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Click left mouse button over the component on the sheet.
			When the dashed rectangle appears around the component - it is selected.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Rotate the component
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Select the component and click the rotate button <%= image_tag 'buttons/arrow-circle-225.png', { :class => 'button' } %> 
			in the toolbar above the sheet.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Connect two components
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Move your mouse to the pin you want to connect with. The pin is a medium red circle
			near the component's symbol. When you've stopped your mouse cursor over the pin, the blue
			circle will appear around that pin showing that you selected that pin <br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/pin-hover.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			Now, press your left mouse button keeping mouse cursor over the pin, 
			<strong>do not unpress it yet</strong> and move a bit away from the pin - the blue dashed line will appear coming out of the selected pin and showing that you are trying to connect
			that pin to some other pin<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/pin-drag.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			Move the cursor, <strong>keeping your left mouse button down</strong> to the pin
			you want connect to until the blue circle appears around that other pin. Only then
			you can release your left mouse button.<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/pin-connect.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			The connection line will appear. It will automaticly create some bends.<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/connection-line-created.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Edit connection
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Move your mouse to the connection line you want to edit. The connection line is the bended line which connects two component' pins. Usually it has dark color like black.
			Click on the connection line to select it.<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/connection-line-select.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			The red rectangles will appear. They are <strong>base points</strong>. They determine where the connection line should follow. Connected together one-to-one and to the component' pins, they
			form a connection line. You can drag them to change the connection line<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/base-point-drag.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			Connection line will be updated immediatly - it is a bit hard for your browser but more pretty. Yet it could be configured (simply run <em>MooChip.lightMode = true</em> within your JS console).<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/base-point-drop.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			You can create base points double-clicking on the connection line.<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/base-point-create.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			Base points are removed with double-clicking on them.<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/base-point-remove.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Remove single connection
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			First of all, select the connection line you want to remove.<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/connection-line-select.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>
			<br />
			Then simply click the <em>Remove</em> button <%= image_tag 'buttons/cross-script.png', { :class => 'button' } %> - and viola!<br />
			<%= image_tag 'screens/connection-line-remove.jpg', { :class => 'screenshot' } %>

	</div>
	
	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Remove component and its connections
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Select the component and click the remove button <%= image_tag 'buttons/cross-script.png', { :class => 'button' } %>

	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Cancel selection

		<div class="tip-body">

	<div class="tip">
		<span class="tip-title">
			Run the simulation

			Connect <strong>DC Source</strong> component to the other components of your sheet
			and click the run the full circuit simulation button <%= image_tag 'buttons/arrow-repeat.png', { :class => 'button' } %>

			Reset simulations
		</span>
		
		<div class="tip-body">
			Click the reset execution button <%= image_tag 'buttons/arrow-circle-double.png', { :class => 'button' } %> in the
